# Lets-Make-Logos

## User Story

AS a freelance web developer
I WANT to generate a simple logo for my projects
SO THAT I don't have to pay a graphic designer

## Description

This repository contains the source code of our very own LOGO GENERATOR! You will find JavaScript files, test.js file, .gitignore, package.json, and node_modules folder. The code for the shapes.test.js was given in the class repository.

This one was a breakthrough project for me, working with Node.js and Operation Oriented Programming has been such a difficult task before this project. The .then promises had me crying! But in the end, we made it through and it was fun to put it all together and see the pages of code come to life! 

## Technologies Used

JavaScript\
Node.JS\
OOP(Operation Oriented Programming)\
SVG
